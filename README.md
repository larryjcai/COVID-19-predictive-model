# COVID-19-predictive-model

Users should download the latest public use data set from the VDH (VDH-COVID-19-PublicUseDataset-ZIPCode.csv). They should then place it in the same folder as my python file (covidModel.py). To run the program open up the terminal and cd into the folder containing the python file. Run the command ‘python3 covidModel.py’.
